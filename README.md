# To Professor Chu:

This Github repository is a repository that contains all work completed by student **Frank Ziegler** for **Object Oriented Design**. 

Each homework assignment will be in a folder entitled "hwX" where X = 1, 2, ... 

To show how my program outputs, I will include:
1. Test text files, titled testX.txt where X = 1, 2, ...
2. Test output files, titled testX_out.txt where X = 1, 2, ...
3. A bash script, titled run_tests.sh, that runs all test text files and appends them to their respective output files.

If you have any questions about this repository, please let me know. Thank you!
