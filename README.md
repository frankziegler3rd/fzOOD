# To Professor Chu:

This Github repository is a repository that contains all work completed by student **Frank Ziegler** for **Object Oriented Design**. 

Each homework assignment will be in a folder entitled "hwX" where X = 1, 2, ... For your convenience, I will also include **screenshots of the code output** in the same folder as the code.

If you have any questions about this repository, please let me know. Thank you!
